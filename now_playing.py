"""
Now Playing Updater for OBS (with VLC Video Source playlists)

This script monitors a folder containing music files used in an OBS VLC Video Source playlist.
When a new track begins playing, the script extracts metadata (Artist, Title, Album) using
the mutagen library and writes it to a text file. OBS can display this text file with a
Text (GDI+) source set to "Read from file".
